National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Executive Summary
Networked technologies touch every corner of the globe and every facet of human life. They have
driven innovation, nurtured freedoms, and spurred economic prosperity. Even so, the very
technologies that enable these benefits offer new opportunities for malicious and unwanted cyber
activities. The risks associated with the Nation’s dependence on these networked technologies led to
the development of Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41): United States Cyber Incident
Coordination, which sets forth principles governing the Federal Government's response to any cyber
incident, whether involving government or private sector entities.
PPD-41 recognizes that the frequency of cyber incidents is increasing, and this trend is unlikely to be
reversed anytime soon. The most significant of these incidents, those likely to result in demonstrable
harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the
public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people, necessitate
deliberative planning, coordination, and exercising of response activities, in order to minimize the
threat and consequences to the Nation, infrastructure, and way of life.
The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP or Plan) was developed according to the
direction of PPD-41 and leveraging doctrine from the National Preparedness System to articulate the
roles and responsibilities, capabilities, and coordinating structures that support how the Nation
responds to and recovers from significant cyber incidents posing risks to critical infrastructure. The
NCIRP is not a tactical or operational plan; rather, it serves as the primary strategic framework for
stakeholders to understand how federal departments and agencies and other national-level partners
provide resources to support response operations. Authored in close coordination with government
and private sector partners, the NCIRP expounds upon the concurrent lines of effort, defined by PPD41, for how the Federal Government will organize its activities to manage the effects of significant
cyber incidents. The concurrent lines of effort are threat response, asset response, intelligence
support, and the affected entity, which undertakes efforts to manage the effects of the incident on its
operations, customers, and workforce. The activities and lead federal agencies for each line of effort
within the Cyber Unified Coordination Group are described below.


The Department of Justice is the lead agency for threat response during a significant cyber
incident, acting through the Federal Bureau of Investigations and National Cyber Investigative
Joint Task Force. Threat response activities include conducting appropriate law enforcement and
national security investigative activity at the affected entity's site; collecting evidence and
gathering intelligence; providing attribution; linking related incidents; identifying additional
affected entities; identifying threat pursuit and disruption opportunities; developing and
executing courses of action to mitigate the immediate threat; and facilitating information sharing
and operational coordination with asset response.



The Department of Homeland Security is the lead agency for asset response during a significant
cyber incident, acting through the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration
Center. Asset response activities include furnishing technical assistance to affected entities to
protect their assets, mitigate vulnerabilities, and reduce impacts of cyber incidents; identifying
other entities that may be at risk and assessing their risk to the same or similar vulnerabilities;
assessing potential risks to the sector or region, including potential cascading effects, and
developing courses of action to mitigate these risks; facilitating information sharing and

4

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

operational coordination with threat response; and providing guidance on how best to utilize
federal resources and capabilities in a timely, effective manner to speed recovery.


Threat and asset responders will share some responsibilities and activities, which may include
communicating with affected entities to understand the nature of the cyber incident; providing
guidance to affected entities on available federal resources and capabilities; promptly
disseminating through appropriate channels intelligence and information learned in the course of
the response; and facilitating information sharing and operational coordination with other Federal
Government entities.



The Office of the Director of National Intelligence is the lead coordinator for intelligence support
during a significant cyber incident, acting through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration
Center. Intelligence support and related activities include providing support to federal asset and
threat agencies and facilitate the building of situational threat awareness and sharing of related
intelligence; the integrated analysis of threat trends and events; the identification of knowledge
gaps; and the ability to degrade or mitigate adversary threat capabilities.



An affected federal agency shall engage in a variety of efforts to manage the impact of a cyber
incident, which may include maintaining business or operational continuity; addressing adverse
financial impacts; protecting privacy; managing liability risks; complying with legal and
regulatory requirements (including disclosure and notification); engaging in communications
with employees or other affected individuals; and dealing with external affairs (e.g., media and
congressional inquiries). The affected federal agency will have primary responsibility for this line
of effort.



When a cyber incident affects a private entity, the Federal Government typically will not play a
role in this line of effort, but it will remain cognizant of the affected entity's response activities,
consistent with the principles above and in coordination with the affected entity. The relevant
sector-specific agency will generally coordinate the Federal Government's efforts to understand
the potential business or operational impact of a cyber incident on private sector critical
infrastructure.

The NCIRP builds upon these lines of effort to illustrate a national commitment to strengthening the
security and resilience of networked technologies and infrastructure. This Plan outlines the structure
and content from which stakeholders can leverage to inform their development of agency-, sector-,
and organization-specific operational response plans. Correspondingly, this Plan should be
understood to be a living document, to be updated as needed to incorporate lessons-learned, to reflect
opportunities and challenges that arise as technology evolves, and to ensure the Plan adequately
addresses a changing threat/hazard environment.

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Introduction
The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 (NCPA) 1 consequently codified in the Homeland
Security Act 2, mandates that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with
appropriate entities and individuals, develop, regularly update, maintain, and exercise adaptable
cyber incident response plans to address cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure. Presidential
Policy Directive (PPD)-41: U.S. Cyber Incident Coordination and the associated Annex, 3 set forth
principles governing the Federal Government’s response to any cyber incident, provide an
architecture for coordinating the response to significant cyber incidents, and required DHS to
develop a National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP or Plan) to address cybersecurity risks to
critical infrastructure. The NCIRP is part of the broader National Preparedness System and
establishes the strategic framework and doctrine for a whole-of-Nation 4 approach to mitigating,
responding to, and recovering from a cyber incident. This approach includes and strongly relies on
public and private partnerships to address major cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure.


Response Plan Purpose and Organization – The NCIRP provides guidance to enable a
coordinated whole-of-Nation approach to response activities and coordination with stakeholders
during a significant cyber incident impacting critical infrastructure. The NCIRP sets common
doctrine and a strategic framework for national, sector, and individual organization cyber
operational plans.



Intended Audience – The intended audience for the NCIRP is U.S. organizations. However, it
may also enhance our international partners’ understanding of the U.S. cyber incident
coordination. This whole-of-Nation concept focuses efforts and enables the full range of
stakeholders—the private and nonprofit sectors (including private and public owners and
operators of critical infrastructure), state, local, tribal, territorial (SLTT) governments, and the
Federal Government—to participate and be full partners in incident response activities.
Government resources alone cannot meet all the needs of those affected by significant cyber
incidents. All elements of the community must be activated, engaged, and integrated to respond
to a significant cyber incident.

Scope
Cyber incident response is an important component of information and communications technology
(ICT) and operational technology programs and systems. Performing incident response effectively is
a complex undertaking and requires substantial planning and resources to establish a successful
incident response capability.
The NCIRP is the strategic framework for operational coordination among federal and SLTT
governments, the private sector, and international partners. Developed according to the guiding
principles outlined in PPD-41 and leveraging doctrine from the National Preparedness System and

the National Incident Management System (NIMS), 5 the NCIRP sets the strategic framework for how
the Nation plans, prepares for, and responds to cyber incidents by establishing an architecture for
coordinating the broader community response during a significant cyber incident in accordance with
U.S. law and policy. A list of authorities is found in Annex A: Authorities and Statutes. The NCIRP
is also designed to integrate and interface with industry standards and best practices for cybersecurity
risk management, as developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST)
Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. 6
The NCIRP is not a tactical or operational plan for responding to cyber incidents. However, it should
serve as the primary strategic framework for stakeholders when developing agency-, sector-, and
organization-specific operational plans. This Plan will help those affected by cyber incidents
understand how federal departments and agencies and other national-level partners provide resources
to support SLTT and private sector response operations. It should also serve as the basis for national
cyber operational playbooks and individual critical infrastructure sector operational coordination
plans, as well as be referenced by individual entities in their own plan development. In all cases,
incident response activities will be conducted in accordance with applicable law and policy.

Guiding Principles
The NCIRP is based on several guiding principles outlined in PPD-41 for the response to any cyber
incident, whether involving government or private sector entities. These principles include:


Shared Responsibility. Individuals, the private sector, and government agencies have a shared
vital interest and complementary roles and responsibilities in protecting the Nation from
malicious cyber activity and managing cyber incidents and their consequences.



Risk-Based Response. The Federal Government will determine its response actions and the
resources it brings to bear based on an assessment of the risks posed to an entity, our national
security, foreign relations, the broader economy, public confidence, privacy and civil liberties, or
the public health and safety of the American people. Critical infrastructure entities also conduct
risk-based response calculations during cyber incidents to ensure the most effective and efficient
utilization of resources and capabilities.



Respecting Affected Entities. To the extent permitted under law, Federal Government responders
will safeguard details of the incident, as well as privacy, civil liberties, and sensitive private
sector information, and generally will defer to affected entities in notifying other affected private
sector entities and the public. In the event of a significant cyber incident where the Federal
Government interest is served by issuing a public statement concerning an incident, federal
responders will coordinate their approach with the affected entities to the extent possible.



Unity of Governmental Effort. Various government entities possess different roles,
responsibilities, authorities, and capabilities that can all be brought to bear on cyber incidents.
These entities must coordinate efforts to achieve optimal results. The first federal agency to
become aware of a cyber incident will rapidly notify other relevant federal agencies to facilitate a
unified federal response and ensure that the right combination of agencies responds to a
particular incident. When responding to a cyber incident in the private sector, unity of effort
synchronizes the overall federal response, which prevents gaps in service and duplicative efforts.
SLTT governments also have responsibilities, authorities, capabilities, and resources that can be

used to respond to a cyber incident; therefore, the Federal Government must be prepared to
partner with SLTT governments in its cyber incident response efforts. The transnational nature of
the Internet and communications infrastructure requires the United States to coordinate with
international partners, as appropriate, in managing cyber incidents.


Enabling Restoration and Recovery. Federal response activities will be conducted in a manner to
facilitate restoration and recovery of an entity that has experienced a cyber incident, balancing
investigative and national security requirements, public health and safety, and the need to return
to normal operations as quickly as possible.

While steady-state activities and the development of a common operational picture are key
components of the NCIRP, the Plan focuses on building the mechanisms needed to respond to a
significant cyber incident. Table 1 below describes the difference between a “cyber incident” and a
“significant cyber incident” as outlined in PPD-41. The Federal Government uses the Cyber Incident
Severity Schema (detailed in Annex B: Cyber Incident Severity Schema) to describe the incident
level, the process to determine the severity of an incident, and the threshold for designating a
significant cyber incident affecting the United States or its interest abroad. The United States
Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) website also provides a list of types of common
ways cyber incidents can occur and exploit information and assets. 7
Table 1: Cyber Incident Definitions from PPD-41
Incident

Definition

Cyber Incident

An event occurring on or conducted through a computer network that
actually or imminently jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of computers, information or communications systems or
networks, physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by computers or
information systems, or information resident thereon.

Significant Cyber Incident

A cyber incident that is (or group of related cyber incidents that together
are) likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security
interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the
public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the
American people.

Relationship to National Preparedness System
While the NCIRP focuses on cyber incident response efforts, the National Preparedness System
outlines a broader architecture that establishes how the broader community 8 prevents, protects
against, mitigates, responds to, and recovers from all threats and hazards. Specifically, the National

and nonprofit sectors, faith-based organizations, and local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and the Federal
Government—and the Nation as a whole. https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1471452095112507e23ad4d85449ff131c2b025743101/Response_FIOP_2nd.pdf

Response Framework (NRF) 9 sets the doctrine and provides guidance for how the Nation builds,
sustains, and delivers the response core capabilities identified in the National Preparedness Goal. 10
To further connect the NCIRP with the NRF, the Homeland Security Act 11 states the Secretary of
DHS, in coordination with the heads of other appropriate federal departments and agencies, and in
accordance with the NCIRP under that Act, shall regularly update, maintain, and exercise the Cyber
Incident Annex to the NRF of the Department. The NCIRP leverages the doctrine, capabilities, and
organizing structures of the NRF, and both the NRF and NCIRP structures align with NIMS as
described below.
NIMS provides the common language and incident management structure for government at all
levels (federal and SLTT) and the private sector, and defines standard command and management
structures. Successful response efforts, including cyber incident responses, depend on a common,
interoperable approach for sharing resources, coordination, and communicating information. NIMS
defines this comprehensive approach and enables the whole-of-Nation12to work together to prevent,
protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the effects of incidents regardless of cause,
size, location, or complexity.
All of the components of the NIMS—resource management, management and coordination, and
communications and information management—provide a common framework by which
jurisdictions and organizations, which vary in authorities, management structures, communication
capabilities, and protocols, integrate with one another to achieve common goals. These concepts can
also apply to cyber incident response, in that they address:


The development of a single set of incident objectives;



The use of a collective, strategic approach to incident management;



The improvement of information flow and coordination;



The creation of a common understanding of joint priorities and limitations;



The need to maintain an agency’s legal authorities; and



The optimization of the combined efforts of all participants in the incident.

The NRF also includes 14 Emergency Support Functions (ESF) 13; these federal coordinating
structures group resources and capabilities into functional areas that are most frequently needed in a
national response. ESFs are an effective way to bundle and manage resources to deliver the core
capabilities outlined in the NRF. These ESFs bring together the capabilities of federal departments
and agencies and other national-level assets to support incident response. The ESFs are not based on

The National Preparedness System refers to whole community vs the NCIRP describing a whole-of-Nation
approach because of the nature of cyber infrastructure and associated incidents. The guidance, programs, processes,
and systems that support each component of the National Preparedness System enable a collaborative, whole
community approach to national preparedness that engages individuals, families, communities, private and nonprofit
sectors, faith-based organizations, and all levels of government. https://www.fema.gov/media-librarydata/20130726-1855-25045-8110/national_preparedness_system_final.pdf

the capabilities of any single department or agency but are groups of organizations that work together
to support an effective response.
Activation of the ESFs, either by the DHS Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or as
directed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, depends upon the response activities needed to
support the incident. Specifically, through ESF #2 (Communications), the Federal Government can
coordinate the response to and recovery from a significant cyber incident that also creates large-scale
physical effects with the communications sector and across the other ESFs. In an incident with cyber
and physical effects, the significant cyber incident response mechanism outlined in the Coordinating
Structures and Integration section of this Plan will coordinate with the established ESFs, to include
ESF #2. A graphic comparing the Cyber Incident Severity Schema and Activation Level of the
National Response Coordination Center is provided in Annex C. This center is a multiagency center
that coordinates the overall federal support for major incidents and emergencies. 14
The next section describes the concurrent lines of effort outlined in PPD-41 and identifies key roles
and responsibilities for not only the federal and SLTT governments’ response but also the private
sectors’ response to a cyber incident as they own and operate the bulk of the Nations’ critical
infrastructure.

Roles and Responsibilities
Every day, various organizations across the public and private sectors manage, respond to, and
investigate cyber incidents through concurrent lines of effort. Fostering unity of effort during
incident response requires a shared understanding of the roles and responsibilities of all participating
organizations, to include roles that may be unique or particularly relevant for protecting the Nation
from malicious cyber activity and managing cyber incidents and their consequences.
The Federal Government maintains a wide range of capabilities and resources that may be required to
respond to a cyber incident, many of them through its cybersecurity centers which are further
described in Annex E: Roles of Federal Cybersecurity Centers. In responding to any cyber incident
and recognizing the shared responsibility for cybersecurity, the Federal Government organizes its’
response activities based upon four concurrent lines of effort: threat response, asset response,
intelligence support, and the affected entity’s internal response activities.
When a cyber incident affects a private entity, the Federal Government will typically not play a direct
role in the affected entities' response activities but will remain cognizant of their activities and
coordinate appropriately with the affected entity. Where possible, and especially where incidents
may escalate on the Cyber Incident Severity Schema, the Federal Government will conduct
coordinated outreach efforts with the affected entity and offer to assist with asset response, threat
response, and intelligence support activities, consistent with the guiding principles described in the
Scope section of this Plan.
Cyber incidents can result from the actions, or inactions, of a single individual. When engaged and
educated, individuals, families, and households can greatly reduce the impact, disruption, and
damage caused by a cyber event. While most cyber incidents may not involve assistance from private
citizens, incidents can reduce the risk and potential impact of a cyber incident to their personal
property. Resources and guidance are available at www.ready.gov/cyber-attack that private citizens

can leverage before, during, and after a cyber incident. US-CERT also provides information to home
users on security risks and countermeasures associated with home Internet connectivity. 15

Concurrent Lines of Effort
Recognizing the shared responsibility for cybersecurity, response activities in the NCIRP are
undertaken through three concurrent lines of effort: threat response, asset response, intelligence
support and related activities. A fourth line of effort is the affected entity’s response efforts. 16 These
concurrent lines of effort provide a foundation for harmonizing various response efforts and fostering
coordination and unity of effort before, during, and after any cyber incident response. Federal and
non-federal entities should remain cognizant of these lines of effort and facilitate their activities
accordingly while responding to cyber incidents.

Affected Entity Response

When a significant cyber incident affects a federal agency, that agency
will have primary responsibility for its response.
When a significant cyber incident affects a private entity, the Federal
Government will typically not play a role in this line of effort, but the
cognizant Sector Specific Agency(ies) will generally coordinate the
Federal Government efforts to understand the potential business or
operational impact of a cyber incident on private sector critical
infrastructure.

Threat and asset responders share some responsibilities and activities, including but not limited to:


Communicating with the affected entity to understand the nature of the cyber incident;



Providing guidance to the affected entity on available federal resources and capabilities;



Promptly disseminating, through appropriate channels, intelligence and information learned in
the course of the response; and



Facilitating information sharing and operational coordination with other entities.

International coordination plays a key role through all the lines of effort. Due to the transnational
nature of the Internet and communications infrastructure, and the global presence and connectivity of

17
Per the Annex to PPD-41, asset and threat response activities for significant cyber incidents affecting DoD or IC
assets are led by those agencies with support from other federal agencies as appropriate. Lead agencies also
coordinate with relevant SSAs, if a cyber incident affects or is likely to affect sectors they represent.
16

11

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

the U.S. private sector, the Federal Government may coordinate with international partners in
response to all aspects of a cyber incident—threat response, asset response, and intelligence support.
The Department of State (DOS) represents the United States in all global diplomatic engagements
across the full range of international policy imperatives, including cyber issues. As stated in the 2011
International Strategy for Cyberspace, diplomacy is a vital and necessary component to addressing
cyber threats and responding to cyber incidents both domestically and internationally. DOS leverages
its diplomats in the embassies and posts around the globe to provide international diplomatic support
for cyber incident response around the clock. While DOS coordinates diplomatic outreach related to
cyber incidents, many federal departments and agencies actively maintain and leverage multilateral
and bilateral partnerships. Similarly, many ICT sector businesses and providers are multinational
businesses with critical international elements and relationships, including interaction with both
policy and operational communities around the world. As appropriate, federal departments and
agencies collaborate internationally and with private sector entities to support international aspects of
cyber incident response.

Threat Response
Threat response activities encompass many resources and capabilities from across the law
enforcement and defense community. Threat response activities during a cyber incident include
investigative, forensic, analytical, and mitigation activities; interdiction of a threat actor; and
providing attribution that may lead to information sharing and operational synchronization with asset
response activities. Threat response activities also include conducting appropriate law enforcement
and national security investigative activities at the affected entity’s site, linking related incidents, and
identifying additional affected or potentially affected entities. As described earlier, threat responders
and asset responders collaborate to foster a unity of effort to facilitate their activities while
responding to incidents. The SLTT community and the private sector play important roles in working
with respective law enforcement entities on threat response activities. Federal agencies with
counterintelligence functions, such as those of DHS, DOJ, DoD, Department of Energy (DOE), and
members of the Intelligence Community (IC), may perform a substantial threat response role when a
significant cyber incident affects their duties or responsibilities, or there is suspicion of activities
conducted a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.

Private Sector
Private sector entities perform critical roles in supporting threat response activities by reporting and
sharing information regarding cyber incidents and malicious cyber activity in a timely manner to
appropriate law enforcement agencies or government entities. Information, communications, and
technology providers and manufacturers—such as Internet service providers, common carriers,
manufacturers of key networking hardware, and major software companies—also play an important
role in the threat response to malicious cyber activity, due to the potential exploitation or use of their
systems by cyber threat actors. Points of contact for reporting incidents to Federal Government
entities are provided in Annex D: Reporting Cyber Incidents to the Federal Government. Private
sector entities should also adhere to regulatory and legal requirements when reporting cyber
incidents. Private sector cybersecurity practitioners and providers that offer critical services (such as
managed security services, indications and warning, cybersecurity assessment, and incident response)
may also possess information concerning malicious cyber activity that is important to enable threat
response activities. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 provides liability and other
legal protections to private sector and certain SLTT government organizations and establishes

12

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

important conditions regarding sharing information with the Federal Government, SLTT government
organizations, and the private sector. 18

State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Governments
Many states and locals have criminal statutes regarding unauthorized access or damage to computer
systems, which could be implicated in a cyber incident. State fusion centers are situated at the
intersection between federal and local law enforcement, and play a role in sharing threat-related
information between federal, SLTT and/or private sector partners. However, state fusion centers vary
greatly in their cyber capacity and capability. Local governments, particularly large cities, play an
important role in local response activities. Often times, private citizens and small businesses do not
have relationships with or access to federal law enforcement or in incident response activities. Local
governments have a critical responsibility to provide a communication bridge to federal and state law
enforcement and incident responders. As identified in the previous sub-section (Private Sector), the
Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 establishes legal protections and important conditions
for sharing information with the Federal Government, SLTT government organizations, and the
private sector.

Federal Government
In response to cyber incidents, federal law enforcement agencies work across SLTT and the Federal
Government, international engagements, and with private sector entities to address both criminal and
national security cyber threats. Federal law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), United States Secret Service (U.S. Secret Service), and U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), conduct threat response
activities related to criminal activity involving their investigative jurisdictions and coordinate
appropriately. Sharing action information in an unclassified format between the IC and first
responders is critical in coordinating incident response activities.
Pursuant to PPD-41, during the event of a significant cyber incident for which a Cyber Unified
Coordination Group (UCG) is convened, the DOJ, through the FBI and the National Cyber
Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), will serve as the lead federal agency for threat response
activities. The specific responsibilities and coordinating roles for this line of effort during a
significant cyber incident are detailed in the Operational Coordination During a Significant Cyber
Incident section of this Plan.
DOJ’s Offices of U.S. Attorneys and its’ Criminal and National Security Divisions, working with
federal law enforcement agencies, use criminal and national security authorities to investigate,
prosecute, and disrupt cyber threats and to apprehend cyber threat actors. Information and evidence
obtained pursuant to appropriate legal process are used to identify the source of cyber incidents and
to gather pertinent cyber threat information. Nationwide coordination of cyber prosecutorial
initiatives is conducted through the DOJ Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Program for
criminal matters and by the DOJ National Security Cyber Specialist Network for cyber threats to the
national security. In addition, DOJ, through the FBI and NCIJTF, shares investigative information
and cyber threat intelligence, as appropriate, with other federal agencies to aid in the analysis of
cyber threats and vulnerabilities. The FBI Cyber Task Forces in all 56 field offices support SLTT

law enforcement in maintaining relationships and sharing information with the private sector,
offering training and certification courses, and coordination of domestic cyber threat investigations.
The U.S. Secret Service has a national network of Electronic Crimes Task Forces, which combine the
resources of academia, the private sector, and SLTT law enforcement to prevent, detect, and
investigate electronic crimes, including potential terrorist attacks against critical infrastructure and
financial payment systems.
DoD is responsible for threat response to cyber incidents affecting DoD assets and the DoD
Information Network (DoDIN). DoD can also support civil authorities for cyber incidents outside the
DoDIN when requested by the lead federal agency, and approved by the appropriate DoD official, or
directed by the President. Such support would be provided based upon the needs of the incident, the
capabilities required, and the readiness of available forces.

Asset Response
Asset response activities include furnishing technical assistance to affected entities, mitigating
vulnerabilities, identifying additional at-risk entities, and assessing their risk to the same or similar
vulnerabilities. These activities could also include communicating with the affected entity to
understand the nature of the cyber incident; providing guidance to the affected entity on available
federal, SLTT, and private sector resources and capabilities; promptly disseminating new intelligence
and information through the appropriate channels; and facilitating information sharing and
operational coordination with other Federal Government, SLTT government, and private sector
entities. Critical asset response activities also include assessing potential risks to a sector or region,
including potential cascading and interdependency effects, developing courses of action to mitigate
these risks, and providing guidance on how best to utilize federal, SLTT, and private sector resources
and capabilities in a timely, effective manner.
Asset and threat responders coordinate and share some responsibilities and activities when
responding to a cyber incident. The roles and responsibilities in asset response vary, which highlights
that unity of effort and shared responsibility is necessary to protect the Nation against cyber
incidents.

Private Sector
The private sector, especially the owners and operators of critical infrastructure, plays a key role in
responding to cyber incidents. Small, medium, and large private sector entities are often the first and
primary responders to cyber incidents. Private companies are responsible for the security of their own
systems, and they are normally the first to identify an incident and are often in the best place to
respond to it. Private entities may have reporting or disclosure requirements related to cyber
incidents, which they have to comply with as they respond to the incident. In most cases, these
incidents are considered routine and are mitigated by the company using internal resources or with
the assistance of contracted services providers. Routine, steady-state information sharing related to
cyber incidents, even when mandatory reporting is not required, alerts other at-risk entities and
allows them to mitigate vulnerabilities that may have cascading impacts to their systems.
Private sector service providers and cybersecurity practitioners offer critical services, such as
managed security services, indications and warning, cybersecurity assessment, and incident response,
which system owners and other asset responders might need when managing an incident. These
private sector resources can serve as surge and specialty support to augment an in-house
cybersecurity team at an affected entity.
Information, communications, and technology providers and manufacturers, such as Internet service
providers, other common carriers, manufacturers of key networking hardware, and major software
14

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

companies, play an important role in defending against and responding to malicious cyber activity.
Effective coordination between these private sector entities and other response organizations is often
essential in cyber incident response.
Critical infrastructure owners and operators work with DHS and relevant sector-specific agencies
(SSA) implementing the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) 19 tenets of public-private
partnership to improve preparedness and manage risk. Due to the tightly interconnected and
interdependent nature of some sectors, companies may also provide information to other entities in
the sector or in other sectors, to facilitate shared situational awareness, contain the incident, and/or
mitigate any damage. Thus, companies will potentially look to share and receive information from a
variety of sources including DHS, SSAs, and federal and SLTT law enforcement and
counterintelligence activities as well as their respective sector Information Sharing Analysis Centers
(ISAC) and other information sharing and analysis organizations.
Most private sector operational information sharing is conducted through ISACs. ISACs are typically
a sector-based type of Information Sharing and Analysis Organization (ISAO) and operate through a
defined sector-based model, meaning that organizations within a certain sector (i.e. financial
services, energy, aviation, etc.) join together to share information about cyber threats. Although
many of these groups are already essential drivers of effective cybersecurity collaboration, some
organizations do not fit neatly within an established sector or have unique needs. ISAOs can be
formed based upon geography, sector, or any other grouping in which companies are interested and is
a group created to gather, analyze, and disseminate cyber threat information. Those organizations
that cannot join an ISAC but have a need for cyber threat information could benefit from
membership in an ISAO. Unlike ISACs, ISAOs are not necessarily tied to critical infrastructure
sectors. 20
In the case of cyber incidents, especially significant cyber incidents, greater coordination may be
needed with the Federal Government, SLTT communities, regulators within the sector, and among
multiple sectors. In addition to responding to situations in which private companies are themselves
the victims of cyber incidents, private entities also respond to situations in which private sector
service providers (especially Internet service providers, managed security service providers, and
other technology vendors) provide support for national-level incident response efforts. During such
an incident, the private sector often provides support or assistance to federal and SLTT departments
and agencies on preparedness and response activities. Federal and SLTT regulators also have
mandatory reporting requirements for certain types of cyber incidents in certain sectors. Depending
on the sector and type of incident, some response actions may require regulator coordination,
approval, and/or regulatory relief.
As appropriate, private sector entities provide for the security of their networks and security
processing of breaches or other incidents through standing in-house or contracted services or use of
external experts. Standing services are a part of the entity’s network structure, and the private sector
entity are encouraged share with government responders the information the standing services
develop or pursue concerning a cyber incident. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015
provides liability and other legal protections to private sector and certain SLTT government
organizations and establishes important conditions regarding sharing information with the Federal
Government, SLTT government organizations, and the private sector. 21

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Government
Ensuring the safety and welfare of citizens is a fundamental responsibility of government at every
level. Toward these objectives, key executives, executive leadership, elected officials, and executive
staff of each SLTT government are responsible for ensuring preparedness, response, and recovery
activities within their jurisdiction.
In cases of cyber incidents, the standard emergency response roles and responsibilities may not be
sufficient to address technical challenges. Each state is responsible for developing a plan that
describes their role in asset response for entities within their state. This state plan should be
consistent with the NCIRP and serve as a cyber annex to their respective state emergency
management plan. Information described in Annex G: Developing an Internal Cyber Incident
Response Plan provides information each state can consider when developing a cyber incident
response plan that coordinates identifying, detecting, mitigating, responding to, and recovering from
cyber incidents in their state.
In establishing strong governance and reporting mechanisms, executives should identify key
individual response points-of-contact for their respective governments and ensure the Federal
Government has the most up-to-date information for these individuals. To facilitate coordination
during a significant cyber incident response operation, each key executive should pre-designate a
primary individual to serve as Senior Official to represent its government. Until amended, by each
key executive, the NCCIC uses the state Homeland Security Advisors as its primary point of contact.
Governance is vital and an enabling factor in states' cyber asset response role. This includes the
supporting legal framework, policies, plans, and procedures that codify the state chief information
security officer's authorities and responsibilities. Governance also outlines how these relate to
executive branch departments and agencies, and other state-operated entities to include (and not
limited to) state and local emergency management functions, law enforcement, the judicial and
legislative branches, ports, airports, and other state owned critical infrastructure. As identified in the
previous sub-section (Private Sector), the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 establishes
legal protections and important conditions for sharing information with the Federal Government,
SLTT government organizations, and the private sector.
Resources available to SLTT communities include, but are not limited to, the following:


Regional Homeland Security Offices and Fusion Centers;



Multi-State ISAC (MS-ISAC) is funded through grants from DHS to support the security of the
SLTT government networks 22 and acts as a focal point for critical information exchange and
coordination between the SLTT community and the Federal Government; every state has an MSISAC primary member, usually the state chief information security officer (CISO);



Local governments that are eligible to apply and receive Urban Area Security Initiative grant
funds are encouraged to include cybersecurity and training programs as part of their
expenditures.



DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate field personnel, including:

22
The MS-ISAC does not help SLTT governments who are seeking to support the private sector. If an SLTT
government is supporting a private sector company in asset response, the SLTT government should engage directly
with the NCCIC.

16

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

•

Supervisory, regional, and district-level Cybersecurity Advisors, who work closely with
SLTT Chief Information Security Officers and cyber emergency management communities
as cybersecurity subject matter experts;

•

Regional directors and Protective Security Advisors, who work closely with state homeland
security advisors as critical infrastructure protection specialists;



The Governors Homeland Security Advisors Council, which provides a structure through which
homeland security advisors from each state, territory, and the District of Columbia discuss
homeland security issues, share information and expertise, and keep governors informed of the
issues affecting homeland security policies in the states;



The SLTT Government Coordinating Councils (SLTT GCC), which strengthen the sector
partnership structure by bringing together geographically diverse experts from a wide range of
critical infrastructure disciplines to ensure that SLTT officials play an integral role in national
critical infrastructure security and resilience efforts.

The National Guard is a force with dual state and federal roles. National Guard forces have expertise
in critical response functions and many also have expertise and capabilities in cyber activities. At the
direction of a State Governor and Adjutant General, the National Guard may perform state missions,
including supporting civil authorities in response to a cyber incident. In certain circumstances, as
permitted by law, the National Guard may be requested to perform federal service or be ordered to
active duty to perform DoD missions, which could include supporting a federal agency in response to
a cyber incident.
Following a cyber incident, SLTT community leaders and points of contact may be asked to provide
advice, support, and assistance to federal departments and agencies on preparedness and response
activities related to SLTT priorities. Cyber incidents can cause cascading and/or physical impacts
that implicate non-cyber incident response activities by SLTT governments. Key executives and
points of contact have a need for situational awareness of the Federal Government’s asset response
activities even when a cyber incident does not affect the SLTT government systems. They should be
prepared to request additional resources from the Federal Government—for instance, under the
Stafford Act—in the event of a cyber incident that exceeds their government’s capabilities.

Federal Government
Federal asset response to a significant cyber incident encompasses many resources and capabilities
from across the federal departments and agencies as well as with the private sector. In response to
cyber incidents, the Federal Government works with both domestic and foreign partners, including
both private sector and governmental entities, to assist in assessments, mitigation, recovery, and
restoration activities. Pursuant to PPD-41, in the event of a significant cyber incident for which a
Cyber UCG is convened, DHS, through the NCCIC, will serve as the lead federal agency for asset
response activities. The specific responsibilities and coordinating roles for this line of effort during a
significant cyber incident are detailed in the Operational Coordination During a Significant Cyber
Incident section of this Plan.
The Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of
2014 directs federal departments and agencies to report major cyber incidents within seven days as
well as submitting to Congress, DHS, and Office of Management and Budget on an annual basis. 23

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

DHS, through the US-CERT, must be notified of all computer security incidents involving a Federal
Government information system with a confirmed impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability
within one hour of being positively identified by the agency’s top-level Computer Security Incident
Response Team (CSIRT), Security Operations Center, or Information Technology department. 24
DHS provides strategic guidance, promotes a national unity of effort, and coordinates the overall
federal effort to promote the security and resilience of the Nation’s critical infrastructure from cyber
and other threats. 25 Per the NCPA, DHS, through the NCCIC, serves as the federal civilian interface
for sharing information related to cybersecurity risks, incidents, analysis, and warnings for federal
and non-federal entities. 26 The NCCIC facilitates information sharing to help identify other entities at
risk to the same or similar vulnerabilities and shares mitigation recommendations and best practices
to protect those at risk. The NCCIC closely coordinates with the SSAs, representatives from multiple
agencies, and the private sector to share cybersecurity information, information about risks and
incidents, analysis, and warnings among federal and non-federal entities, and to facilitate
coordination regarding cybersecurity risks and incidents across the civilian communities, SLTT
governments, and the private sector. Federal asset response support to the private sector from the
NCCIC in the form of on-site technical assistance is generally contingent on a request from or
consent of the supported entity.
SSAs also play a role in sector coordination, working closely with DHS and serving as a day-to-day
federal interface to prioritize and coordinate activities within their respective sectors; carrying out
incident management responsibilities consistent with statutory authority and other appropriate
policies, directives, or regulations; and providing support or facilitating technical assistance and
consultations for that sector to identify vulnerabilities and help mitigate incidents, as appropriate.
DHS ensures consistent and integrated approaches across various critical infrastructure sectors, and a
nationwide approach including both unity of effort and unity of messages.
DHS, working with relevant SSAs, also coordinates the Government’s efforts to understand the
potential business or operational impact of a cyber incident on critical infrastructure in a given sector
and across sectors. The relevant SSA will generally coordinate the Federal Government’s efforts to
understand the potential business or operational impact of a cyber incident on private sector critical
infrastructure. SSAs receive support from the DHS NCCIC and the National Infrastructure
Coordinating Center to maintain and provide situational awareness on threats, incidents, or events
impacting critical infrastructure and to facilitate information sharing. This includes a near-real-time
capability to provide SSA reports, coordinated with FEMA ESF reporting provided by the National
Response Coordination Center, and the capability to solicit and receive information on incidents
from public and private sector critical infrastructure partners. Because SSAs often have authorities,
responsibilities, and partnerships with private industry that extend beyond security and resilience
issues, SSAs play a lead role in integrating response to the technical aspects of cybersecurity
incidents with efforts to mitigate the systemic impacts of such incidents to sectors.

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

In responding to cyber incidents, DHS also works with foreign partners to exchange information and
coordinate incident response activities. This international coordination principally occurs between the
NCCIC and its foreign government CSIRT counterparts and builds on regular information sharing
and operational coordination relationships. The DOC coordinates with federal, international, and
private sector partners on the impacts of cyber incidents on the Internet ecosystem: the domain name
system and the digital economy platform representatives to assess those impacts. Through the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration and NIST, DOC serves as the
Nation’s authority on cybersecurity risk management practices and also fulfills responsibilities under
the Defense Production Act 27 through the Bureau of Industry and Security, including support to
critical infrastructure.
In some cases, regulatory or contract requirements could impose certain obligations on the affected
entity related to asset response support, such as mandatory reporting requirements and/or national
security determinations that may override normal consultative processes. Additionally, where they
have relevant authority, federal regulators should be engaged early in the incident response process to
ensure that actions requiring waiver or other approval or notification can be quickly executed.
Regulators may also be able to facilitate coordinated actions of their respective sectors as necessary
during significant cyber incidents.
DoD will be responsible for managing the asset response affected military assets and the DoDIN.
DoD can also support civil authorities in responding to cyber incidents outside the DoDIN through a
Defense Support of Civil Authorities request based upon a request by the lead federal agency and
approved by the appropriate DoD official or directed by the President. Support would be provided
based on the needs of the incident, the capabilities required, and the readiness of available forces.
When incidents affect IC assets, the IC Security Coordination Center (IC SCC) is responsible for
asset response. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) manages the threat and
asset response for the integrated defense of the IC information environment through the IC SCC, in
conjunction with IC mission partners and with support from other federal agencies, as appropriate.

Intelligence Support
Intelligence and related supporting activities play an important role to better understand the cyber
incident and existing targeted diplomatic, economic, or military capabilities to respond and share
threat and mitigation information with other potential affected entities or responders. Especially
during a significant cyber incident, asset and threat responders should leverage intelligence support
activities as necessary to build situational threat awareness; share related threat indicators and
analysis of threats; identify and acknowledge gaps; and ultimately create a comprehensive picture of
the incident.

State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Government
States fusion centers involve various levels of state government, private sector entities, and the
public—though the level of involvement of some of these participants will vary based on specific
circumstances. The fusion process should be organized and coordinated, at a minimum, on a
statewide level, and each state should establish and maintain a center to facilitate the fusion process.
Though the foundation of fusion centers is the law enforcement intelligence component, center
leadership should evaluate their respective jurisdictions to determine what public safety and private
sector entities should participate in the fusion center.

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Federal Government
ODNI, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC), provides intelligence
support to federal agencies in response to cyber incidents. Pursuant to PPD-41, in the event of a
significant cyber incident for which a Cyber UCG is convened, ODNI, through CTIIC, will serve as
the lead federal agency for intelligence support and related activities. The specific responsibilities
and coordinating roles for this line of effort during a significant cyber incident are detailed in the
Operational Coordination During a Significant Cyber Incident section of this Plan.
In this role, CTIIC coordinates development of federal intelligence information for the other federal
cybersecurity centers and federal stakeholders. This could include pursuing declassification of
intelligence and/or “tear-line” reports at different classification levels as appropriate to the
circumstances of the incident and overall U.S. equities. CTIIC also coordinates any intelligence
collection activities that may take place as part of the incident through the National Intelligence
Manager for Cyber.
Each intelligence operational center has its own organic intelligence support that aligns to its
operational responsibilities. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis has responsibilities under
Title 6 28 to deliver intelligence to SLTT and private sector partners and develop intelligence from
those partners for the Department and the IC. In addition, it provides intelligence support to the
NCCIC’s private sector information sharing mission including gathering intelligence requirements
from critical private sector companies and if the DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate
concurs with the requirements can submit as formal requirements into the intelligence process.
The FBI collects and coordinates the sharing of relevant intelligence and other information between
FBI domestic personnel and FBI staff assigned to Legal Attaché offices around the world;
coordinates the sharing of intelligence among and between federal agencies and international
intelligence and law enforcement elements; produces and shares analytical products, including those
that assess threats to the homeland and inform related planning, capability development, and
operational activities; and coordinates with ODNI mission and support centers that provide unique
capabilities for homeland security partners. 29
The National Security Agency Cybersecurity Threat Operations Center (NCTOC) is the 24/7/365
NSA element that characterizes and assesses foreign cybersecurity threats. The NCTOC informs
partners of current and potential malicious cyber activity through its analysis of foreign intelligence,
with a focus on adversary computer network attacks, capabilities, and exploitations. Upon request,
the NCTOC also provides technical assistance to U.S. Government departments and agencies.
The DoD actively characterizes and assesses foreign cybersecurity threats and informs the relevant
interagency partners of current and potential malicious cyber activity. Upon request, the DoD
intelligence components may provide technical assistance to U.S. Government departments and
agencies; other DoD elements may provide support to civil authorities in accordance with applicable
law and policy. The IC may identify classified information, indicating a potential credible cyber
threat to an SLTT, critical infrastructure owner/operator, or other private sector entity. In accordance
with Section 4 of Executive Order 13636, DHS and/or the FBI provide appropriate notification to the
targeted entity. 30 Where available, declassified threat detection and mitigation information may also
be provided. In circumstances where the source of threat identification, nature of the adversary, or

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

other factors of national security concern exist, incident response processes and procedures adhere to
all guidelines and directions for handling matters of national security.

Affected Entity’s Response
Entities affected by a significant cyber incident usually undertake activities to manage the effects of
the cyber incident on its operations, customers, and workforce, to include complying with various
legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations. When a federal agency is an affected entity, that agency
has primary responsibility for engaging in a variety of efforts to manage the impact of the cyber
incident. These efforts could include, but not limited to:


Maintaining business or operational continuity;



Mitigating potential health and safety impacts;



Addressing adverse financial impacts;



Protecting privacy;



Managing liability risk;



Complying with legal and regulatory requirements (including disclosure and notification);



Engaging in communications with employees or other affected individuals; and



Managing external affairs (e.g., media and congressional inquiries).

When a cyber incident affects a private entity, the Federal Government typically will not play a role
in this line of effort, but it will remain cognizant of the affected entity’s response activities,
consistent with the principles above and in coordination with the affected entity. The relevant SSA
will generally coordinate the Federal Government’s efforts to understand the potential business or
operational impact of a cyber incident on private sector critical infrastructure.

Cyber Incidents Involving Personally Identifiable Information
As it relates to cyber incidents affecting civilian Federal Government agencies, if the facts and
circumstances lead to a reasonable suspicion that the known or suspected cyber incident involves
personally identifiable information, then the appropriate senior agency officials for privacy will be
notified and lead any necessary personally identifiable information incident response process, as
required by the Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-07-1612, Safeguarding Against
and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information (and its subsequent revisions),
and the agency’s Breach Response Plan. 31

Core Capabilities
Core capabilities are the distinct critical elements needed to conduct the threat response, asset
response, and intelligence support activities in response to a cyber incident. Core capabilities are the
activities that generally must be accomplished in cyber incident response, regardless of which levels
of government are involved. They provide a common vocabulary to describe the significant functions
that must be developed and executed across the whole-of-Nation to ensure preparedness.

21

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Core capability application may be achieved with any combination of properly planned, organized,
and trained personnel and deployed through various approaches such as the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework or cybersecurity activities developed by the private sector. The National Preparedness
Goal organizes the core capabilities into mission areas. These capabilities are aligned in Annex H:
Core Capability/NIST Cybersecurity Framework/PPD-41 Crosswalk.
The capabilities are briefly described in this section and in further detail in Annex F: Core
Capabilities and align with the National Preparedness Goal core capabilities. 32 While Annex F is not
an exhaustive list of capabilities, it provides a description of the capabilities that should be developed
and utilized for particular needs, and roles, responsibilities, and authorities for the nature and scope
of the cyber incident. All levels of government, private and non-profit sector organizations, and
critical infrastructure owners and operators should assess their particular risks to identify their core
capability requirements. Annex I describes additional resources that can be leveraged by both the
private and public sector. Those resources can also serve as a starting point for understanding cyber
incident response, vulnerability updates, data breach information, risk management, and
organizations.
Responding to a cyber incident, like incident response for all other threats and hazards, is a shared
responsibility. The whole-of-Nation must work together to ensure the United States is optimally
prepared for cyber incidents; recognizing that not every network/system faces the same risks. By
engaging the whole-of-Nation to build and deliver the cyber response core capabilities, the Nation is
better prepared to respond to any threat or hazard, assist in restoring basic services and community
functionality, and facilitate the integration of recovery activities.

Access Control and Identity Verification
Description: Apply and support necessary physical, technological, and cyber measures to control
admittance to critical locations and systems, which is also referred to as Authentication and
Authorization. This capability relies on the implementation and maintenance of protocols to verify
identity and authorize, grant, or deny access to specific IT systems and networks.

Cybersecurity
Description: Protect (and, if needed, restore) computer networks, electronic communications
systems, information, and services from damage, unauthorized use, and exploitation. More
commonly referred to as information security, these activities ensure the security, reliability,
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information, records, and communications
systems and services through collaborative initiatives and efforts.

Forensics and Attribution
Description: Forensic investigations and efforts to provide attribution for an incident are
complementary functions that often occur in parallel during a significant cyber incident.

Forensics: Forensics is the term for discovering and identifying information relevant to an
investigation through both scientific and intelligence-based acumen. In the context of a cyber
incident, forensics refers to a number of technical disciplines related to the duplication, extraction,
and analysis of data to uncover artifacts relevant to identifying malicious cyber activity. Forensics
includes several sub-disciplines, including host-based forensics, network and packet data forensics,

32

https://www.fema.gov/core-capabilities

22

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

memory analysis, data correlation, and malware analysis.
During the response to a significant cyber incident, government agencies and private sector partners
frequently conduct simultaneous analysis and share analytical results with each other to create a
common understanding regarding the malicious cyber activity and how to defend against these or
similar activity. In the days following an incident, a number of different threat, asset, and business
response organizations may also engage in simultaneous forensic analysis. Although these lines of
effort may appear to be duplicative, findings from these efforts could vary depending on the entities’
varied access to particularized datasets or holdings.

Attribution: Attribution identifies an adversary linked to a particular incident. It is the culmination
of the review of evidence and intelligence gathered during an incident which results in an assessment
that identifies individuals or organizations which likely played a role in the cyber incident.
Attribution occurs over the lifecycle of an investigation and may not be known at the onset of a cyber
incident response. Although the development of attribution for a significant cyber incident is one of
the primary functions of lead federal response agencies, other government and private sector entities
have a significant role to play in determining attribution.
An assessment regarding attribution for an incident is not only important for government agencies
conducting criminal or national security investigations; it could also be significant to an affected
entity as it considers whether to pursue additional legal or civil action against threat actors.
This core capability also includes unique and technical activities that support computer network and
asset analysis during an incident. These supporting activities contribute to awareness of a
comprehensive picture, which ultimately helps reduce the impact of a current incident and prevent
future cyber incidents from spreading across the network.

Infrastructure Systems
Description: Stabilize critical infrastructure functions, minimize health and safety threats, and
efficiently respond and recover systems and services to support a viable, resilient community
following malicious cyber activity. Critical infrastructure and cyber networks are interdependent. In a
response to a cyber incident, this capability focuses on stabilizing the infrastructure assets and
entities, repairing damaged assets, regaining control of remote assets, and assessing potential risks to
the critical infrastructure sector at large.

Intelligence and Information Sharing
Description: Provide timely, accurate, and actionable information resulting from the planning,
direction, collection, exploitation, processing, analysis, production, dissemination, evaluation, and
feedback of available information concerning threats of malicious cyber activity to the United States,
its people, property, or interests. Intelligence and information sharing is the ability to exchange
intelligence, information, data, or knowledge among government or private sector entities, as
necessary.
In the context of a cyber incident, this capability involves the effective implementation of the
intelligence cycle and other information collection and sharing processes by federal and SLTT
entities, the private sector, and international partners to develop situational awareness of potential
cyber threats to the United States.

Interdiction and Disruption
Description: Delay, divert, intercept, halt, apprehend, or secure threats related to malicious cyber
activity. In the context of a cyber incident, these threats include people, software, hardware, or
23

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

activities that pose a threat to the Nation’s cyber networks and infrastructure. This includes those
interdiction and disruption activities that may be undertaken in response to specific, actionable
intelligence of a cyber threat. Interdiction and disruption may include the targeting of persons,
programs, or equipment or machines to stop or thwart threat activities and employing technical and
other means to prevent malicious cyber activities. Interdiction and disruption capabilities help thwart
emerging or developing cyber threats and neutralize operations. These capabilities should be utilized
in a manner that preserves evidence and the Government’s ability to prosecute those who violate the
law.

Logistics and Supply Chain Management
Description: Facilitate and assist with delivery of essential commodities, equipment, and services in
support of responses to systems and networks impacted by malicious cyber activity. Synchronize
logistics capabilities and enable the restoration of impacted supply chains.
In the context of a cyber incident, this capability focuses on providing the logistical or operational
support to achieve cyber incident response priorities established by leadership through identifying,
prioritizing, and coordinating immediate response resource requirements.

Operational Communications
Description: Ensure the capacity for timely communications in support of security, situational
awareness, and operations, by any and all means available, among and between entities affected by
the malicious cyber activity and all responders.
In the context of a cyber incident, this capability includes identifying federal support organizations,
capabilities, and teams with internal interoperable voice, video, and data systems and networks
essential for effective cyber incident response operations. In a cyber incident, this capability focuses
on the timely, dynamic, and reliable movement and processing of incident information in a form that
meets the needs of decision makers at all levels of government and authorized participating private
sector partner organizations.

Operational Coordination
Description: Establish and maintain a unified and coordinated operational structure and process that
appropriately integrate all critical stakeholders and support execution of core capabilities. This is the
capability to conduct actions and activities that enable decision makers across the whole-of-Nation to
determine appropriate courses of action and to provide oversight for complex operations, to achieve
unity of effort and effective outcomes. Operational coordination, in accordance with the principles of
the NIMS and the Incident Command System, coordinates the threat response, asset response, and
intelligence support activities in the face of a cyber threat or in response to an act of terrorism
committed in the homeland. Unity of message is included within the guiding principles. Further
information is available in Annex D: Reporting Cyber Incidents to the Federal Government.
In the context of a cyber incident, this core capability includes efforts to coordinate activities across
and among all levels of government and with private sector partners. This capability involves
national operations centers, as well as on-scene response activities that manage and contribute to
multi-agency efforts.

Planning
Description: Conduct a systematic process engaging the whole-of-Nation, as appropriate, in the
development of executable strategic, operational, and/or tactical-level approaches to meet defined
24

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

objectives.
In the context of a cyber incident, planning includes both deliberate planning and incident action
planning. Deliberate planning involves developing strategic, operational, and tactical plans to
prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from a cyber incident.
Incident action planning occurs in a time-constrained environment to develop or rapidly adapt
operational and tactical plans in response to an imminent or ongoing cyber incident.

Public Information and Warning
Description: Deliver coordinated, prompt, reliable, and actionable information to the whole-ofNation and the public, as appropriate, through the use of clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally
and linguistically appropriate methods to effectively relay information regarding significant threats or
malicious cyber activity, as well as the actions being taken and the assistance being made available,
as appropriate. 33
In the context of a significant cyber incident, this capability uses effective and accessible indications
and warning systems to communicate significant cyber threats to involved or potentially involved
operators, security officials, and the public (including alerts, detection capabilities, and other
necessary and appropriate assets).

Screening, Search, and Detection
Description: Identify, discover, or locate threats of malicious cyber activity through active and
passive surveillance and search procedures. This may include the use of systematic examinations and
assessments, sensor technologies, or physical investigation and intelligence.
In the context of a cyber incident, this capability includes the measures which may be taken in
response to actionable intelligence that indicates potential targets or types of malicious cyber activity,
or the threat actors planning such activity. Measures may also be taken to verify or characterize a
cyber threat that has already been located. Screening relative to a cyber incident may include
monitoring the status of the network, assets, sensors, and other technologies that provide information
on the security posture that may determine further action as necessary.

Situational Assessment
Description: Provide all decision makers with timely, decision-relevant information regarding the
nature and extent of the malicious cyber activity, any cascading effects, and the status of the
response.
In the context of a cyber incident, this capability focuses on rapidly processing and communicating
large quantities of information from across the broader community, from the field level to the
national level, to provide all decision makers with the most current and accurate information
possible.

Threats and Hazards Identification
Description: Identify the threats of malicious cyber activity to networks and system; determine the
frequency and magnitude of those threats; and incorporate this into analysis and planning processes

33

The President of the United States has directed the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to
coordinate with each other to execute key responsibilities that provide public information and warning to the Nation
regarding threats and incidents.
25

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

so as to clearly understand the needs of an entity.
In the context of a cyber incident, this capability involves the continual process of collecting timely
and accurate data on cyber threats, including accounting for the future impacts of technology
advancements, to meet the needs of analysts and decision makers. Effective Threats and Hazards
Identification for a cyber incident is supported by standardized data sets, platforms, methodologies,
terminologies, metrics, and reporting to unify levels of effort across all layers of government and the
private sector, reducing redundancies.

Coordinating Structures and Integration
Successfully managing cyber incidents requires a whole-of-Nation approach (as described in the
introduction of this document) that facilitates coordination among all stakeholders, including the
private sector, SLTT governments, federal agencies, and international partners. Governing entities
organize that coordination through established structures that promote unity of effort during incident
response.
Coordinating structures provide a mechanism for representatives of entities that are affected by or are
responsible for responding to a cyber incident to coordinate and facilitate response activities. These
coordination and response activities may include preparedness activities, the delivery of capabilities,
development operational plans, coordination of response personnel and activities, the crafting of
unified public messaging and alerts, and weighing the technical, operational, political, and policy
implications of varying courses of action.
While existing policies and coordinating structures can handle the vast majority of cyber incidents,
significant cyber incidents may require a unique approach to coordinating the whole-of-Nation
response. Pursuant to PPD-41, the U.S. Government will establish a Cyber UCG as the primary
method for coordinating between and among federal agencies responding to a significant cyber
incident, as well as for integrating SLTT governments and private sector partners into incident
response efforts as appropriate for the specific incident. Other coordinating structures should be
prepared to integrate and interoperate with a Cyber UCG, if one is established.
This section describes the major coordination structures in place across stakeholder communities that
can be leveraged for response to cyber incidents requiring external coordination. Specifically, it
describes how these structures will be leveraged, and additional structures incorporated, to provide
operational coordination in response to significant cyber incidents.

Coordinating Structures
Stakeholders can utilize a variety of existing coordinating structures during any cyber incident to
facilitate information sharing, coordinate response activities, access technical assistance and other
resources, provide policy coordination and direction, and enable effective response. Most cyber
incidents that occur on a daily basis are considered routine, and their responses are handled internally
by the affected entity. As such, affected entities may choose to combine any of the coordinating
structures below as deemed necessary to address the unique nature of the incident and specific
organizational or sector needs. For significant cyber incidents, or cyber incidents that have
implications for national security or public health and safety, PPD-41 establishes lead federal
agencies and a coordinating structures framework with operational response planning and activities
coordinated through a Cyber UCG.

Private Sector
For many years, the private sector has successfully engaged in coordination efforts between and
across industry and government around detection, prevention, mitigation, and response to cyber
26

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

incidents through information sharing, analysis, and collaboration. Each of the 16 critical
infrastructure sectors and sub-sectors designated under PPD-21: Critical Infrastructure Security and
Resilience, 34 has a self-organized and self-governed Sector Coordinating Council (SCC). SCC
members include critical infrastructure owners and operators, industry trade associations, and others
across the private sector. SCCs provide a forum for members to engage with others across their
sector, companion Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs), and SSAs to collaboratively address
the full range of sector-specific and cross-sector critical infrastructure security and resilience policy
and strategy efforts.
In addition, the private sector critical infrastructure community has developed its own coordination
efforts through established ISACs. ISACs are based in and organized and governed by the private
sector (with the exception of the MS-ISAC discussed later), with operational capabilities that support
the public-private partnership around critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity every day.
The National Council of ISACs routinely facilitates cross-sector coordination to further productive
engagement across the private sector and with government at the federal, state, and local levels.
As mentioned earlier, in accordance with policy established by Executive Order 13691, DHS is
facilitating efforts to identify procedures to create and accredit ISAOs 35 to allow groups of
stakeholders to create information sharing groups based on affinity among members (e.g., geography,
industry or community segment, or threat exposure) that could provide a more formalized structure
for information sharing and the provision of technical assistance. Some organizations, including
those that are well established and delivering value every day, may be recognized as an ISAO and or
ISAC, or as a member of more than one, concurrently. ISACs predate and are a subset of ISAOs.

State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Governments
These levels of government also have a variety of coordination structures available to them for cyber
incident response. These structures support information sharing, incident response, operational
coordination, and collaboration on policy initiatives among participating governments.
As with private sector organizations, SLTT governments can be members of ISACs, ISAOs, or other
information sharing organizations. They could also be members of the SLTT GCC at the national
policy coordination level. For incidents on SLTT government networks MS-ISAC provides
information sharing and technical assistance to its members and has established relationships with the
Federal Government. As owners and operators of critical infrastructure and key resources, certain
SLTT government agencies could also be members of sector-specific ISACs and may also develop
unique structures, tailored to their jurisdiction’s needs, to provide coordination and direction to
response officials during a cyber incident. Many also collaborate with one another through selected
cyber information sharing groups or organizations such as the National Association of State Chief
Information Officers or the National Governors’ Association.
While many SLTT governments are developing and utilizing operational coordination structures for
cyber incident response, they have not all adopted a standard approach. Some may designate their
state or major urban area fusion center as the primary contact and information sharing hub for cyber
incident coordination while others could leverage their respective emergency or security operations
center. For cyber incidents with physical effects, or that have consequences that must be managed in
collaboration with other emergency management agencies (e.g., fire departments, public health
agencies, human services offices), emergency operations centers will also likely provide important

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

information sharing and incident management functions. At the state/territory level, emergency
operations centers often coordinate resource requests with federal agencies, including FEMA and
DoD, and provide operational coordination with the National Guard. The SLTT community are
encouraged to provide cross-functional training in cybersecurity for the employees of their
emergency operations center. As appropriate, cyber incident responders should also receive
emergency response and emergency operations center training.

Federal Government
The Federal Government organizes coordinating structures into three categories for cyber incident
response:


National policy level coordination through the Cyber Response Group (CRG), 36



Operational coordination through Federal Cybersecurity Centers and federal agencies, and



Sector coordination through the SSAs and GCCs.

To coordinate policy at the National level, PPD-41 assigns the Assistant to the President for
Homeland Security and Counterterrorism the responsibility to convene and chair the CRG to
coordinate development and implementation of Federal Government policy and strategy with respect
to significant cyber incidents affecting the Nation or its interests abroad. The CRG will coordinate
the development and implementation of U.S. Government policy and strategy for responding to
significant cyber incidents. Federal departments and agencies, including relevant cybersecurity
centers, are invited to participate in the CRG, as appropriate, based on their respective roles,
responsibilities, and expertise or in the circumstances of a given incident or grouping of incidents.
Federal agencies, including SSAs that regularly participate in the CRG must establish and implement
enhanced coordination procedures to manage significant cyber incidents that exceed their standing
response capacities.
The Federal Government has established seven cybersecurity centers, with missions that include
executing cyber operations, enhancing information sharing, maintaining situational awareness, and
serving as conduits between public and private sector entities. Any or all of these centers should
coordinate with federal entities and provide support to cyber incident response to the extent
circumstances dictate and authorities permit. Pursuant to PPD-41, three of these centers coordinate
significant cyber incident response activities within a Cyber UCG: the NCCIC, the NCIJTF, and
CTIIC.
The Federal Government has also designated a number of SSAs to lead their sector GCCs, which are
governmental counterparts to SCCs. SSAs are designated for each of the 16 critical infrastructure
sectors designated under PPD-21. SSAs leverage their particular knowledge and expertise to fulfill a
number of information sharing, coordination, incident response, and technical assistance
responsibilities to their assigned critical infrastructure sector(s), as detailed in PPD-21 and the NIPP.
GCCs include other government agencies with authorities and expertise in a given sector; robust
engagement across GCC participants will enable interagency and interjurisdictional coordination by
including broader participation from federal and SLTT governments, as appropriate to the needs of
each sector.

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

International
International information sharing takes place through a variety of mechanisms in both the public and
private sectors. Many organizations have information sharing relationships that extend to
international partner companies and governments. International operational coordination can occur
through relationships that federal departments and agencies have with their foreign counterparts and
with international organizations, through formal diplomatic channels managed by DOS and through
the relationships that private firms have internally, with other private sector entities, with national
governments, and with international organizations.
Many federal agencies and cybersecurity centers have relationships with counterparts in foreign
nations and routinely share information and collaborate, both during steady state and cyber incidents.
Federal law enforcement agencies also maintain information sharing channels with foreign
counterparts and the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) to facilitate
international investigations. The FBI, through its Legal Attaché program, has designated Cyber
liaison attaches stationed in U.S. Embassies. DHS/ICE HSI has broad legal authority to enforce a
diverse array of federal statutes and uses this authority to investigate all types of cross-border
criminal activity. The U.S. Secret Service maximizes partnerships with international law enforcement
counterparts through overseas field offices and by forward deploying the Electronic Crimes Special
Agent Program to international working groups. The NCCIC collaborates with international CSIRT
partners to obtain situational awareness and determine priorities for protection and response.
Organizations such as the DOS Overseas Security Advisory Council, for example, coordinates
information sharing and collaborative security activity and analysis for U.S. private sector interests
abroad through an industry representative council structure and established channels at U.S.
embassies and other diplomatic posts. Additionally, some ISACs have chosen to open membership to
firms and organizations located in friendly foreign nations, with safeguards in place to preserve
confidentiality of information restricted to U.S. participants.
Given existing relationships and the overlapping policy and operational issues that may arise during a
significant cyber incident, it is important to note that international coordination will likely occur
through multiple channels concurrently.

Operational Coordination During a Significant Cyber Incident
Cyber incidents affect domestic stakeholders on an ongoing basis. The vast majority of these
incidents pose no demonstrable risk to the U.S. national security interests, foreign relations,
economy, public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety and thus do not rise to the
designation of a significant cyber incident as defined by PPD-41 and the accompanying Cyber
Incident Severity Schema in Annex B. Such cyber incidents are resolved either by the affected entity
alone or with routine levels of support from, and in coordination with, other private sector
stakeholders and/or from SLTT, federal, or international government agencies. In the event of a
significant cyber incident, the Federal Government may form a Cyber UCG as the primary method
for coordinating between and among federal agencies responding to a significant cyber incident and
for integrating private sector partners into incident response efforts as appropriate.

Determination of Incident Severity
The Federal Government adopted the Cyber Incident Severity Schema in Annex B as a common
framework and shared understanding to evaluate and assess cyber incidents at all federal departments
and agencies when determining the severity of a cyber incident. Cyber incidents rated a “3” or
greater will equate to a significant cyber incident. Federal Government departments and agencies
shall leverage the Cyber Incident Severity Schema when assessing the severity level and the potential
impact of cyber incidents to ensure common terminology, appropriate information sharing, and
29

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

proper management to effectively address an incident. As referenced earlier, Annex C compares the
Cyber Incident Severity Schema and Activation Level of the National Response Coordination Center
to demonstrate alignment cyber and physical incidents. When assessing the severity of a potentially
significant incident, the federal cybersecurity centers that serve as lead federal agencies under PPD41 (the NCCIC, NCIJTF, and CTIIC) will consult to make a joint assessment of severity.
Our Nation’s critical infrastructure sectors are composed of public and private owners and operators,
both of which provide vital services and possess unique expertise and experience that the Federal
Government and Nation rely heavily upon. Therefore, when determining incident severity, DHS,
through the NCCIC and the SSAs of sectors affected or likely to be affected, may consult with sector
leadership and private sector owners and operators through organizations such as the sector ISAC(s),
SCC, GCC, the National Council of ISACs, MS-ISAC, and/or the Partnership for Critical
Infrastructure Security if the incident affects or is likely to affect a non-federal entity in one or more
of the critical infrastructure sectors. The private sector assessment would inform the NCCIC severity
rating of a cyber incident.
With the majority of critical infrastructure owned and operated by the private sector, it is more than
likely that the Federal Government may learn of a potential significant cyber incident through
voluntary self-reporting and information sharing from the affected entity or a sector coordinating
mechanism. Non-federal entities are also encouraged to utilize the Cyber Incident Severity Schema
and/or the NCCIC Cyber Incident Scoring System 37 to help organizations provide a repeatable and
consistent mechanism for estimating the risk of an incident.
Additionally, when a significant cyber incident affects a private sector stakeholder, SLTT
government, or international counterpart, they have several options for voluntarily sharing the issue
with federal authorities including:


The NCCIC, FBI, or NCIJTF;



Applicable SSA(s) or regulators; or



The local field office of federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, U.S. Secret
Service, U.S. ICE/HSI, or relevant Military Criminal Investigative Organizations if defense
related.

Points of contact for reporting incidents to Federal Government entities are provided in Annex D:
Reporting Cyber Incidents to the Federal Government. In addition to voluntary reporting, affected
entities that have mandatory reporting requirements according to law, regulation, or contract must
continue to comply with such obligations.
The federal agency that receives the report will coordinate with other federal agencies in responding
to the incident, including determining whether or not to establish a Cyber UCG to coordinate the
response to the significant cyber incident. As a part of this determination, stakeholders can provide
information and assessments to federal agencies regarding their view of the severity of the incident
for their entity and for their sector. Federal agencies will leverage these assessments and engage with
the affected entity for discussion as part of the decision process. As appropriate, the Federal
Government also engages with relevant private sector organizations, ISACs, ISAOs, SCCs, SLTT
governments, and/or international stakeholders for consultation about the severity and scope of the
incident.

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Enhanced Coordination Procedures
Per PPD-41, each federal agency that regularly participates in the CRG, including SSAs, ensures that
it has the standing capacity to execute its role in cyber incident response. Agencies establish
enhanced coordination procedures to prepare for significant cyber incidents that exceed its standing
capacity. These procedures require dedicated leadership, supporting personnel, available facilities
(physical and communications), and internal processes enabling it to manage a significant cyber
incident under demands that would exceed its capacity to coordinate under normal operating
conditions.
Enhanced coordination procedures help to:


Identify the appropriate pathways for communicating with other federal agencies during a
significant cyber incident, including the relevant agency points-of-contact, and for notifying the
CRG that enhanced coordination procedures were activated or initiated;



Highlight internal communications and decision-making processes that are consistent with
effective incident coordination; and



Outline processes for maintaining these procedures.

In addition, each federal agency’s enhanced coordination procedures identify the agency’s processes
and existing capabilities to coordinate cyber incident response activities in a manner consistent with
PPD-41. Government and private sector personnel should obtain the necessary clearances and
accesses to facilitate the quick sharing of information. PPD-41 also directs SSAs to develop or
update sector-specific procedures, as needed and in consultation with the sector(s), for enhanced
coordination to support response to a significant cyber incident, consistent with this directive. These
sector-focused procedures serve as a key mechanism for integrating government and private sector
response processes, including processes for accounting for and responding to the business impacts of
significant incidents.

Cyber UCG
A Cyber UCG, per PPD-41, serves as the primary national operational coordination mechanism
between and among federal agencies responsible for identifying and developing operational response
plans and activities during a significant cyber incident, as well as for integrating private sector
partners and the SLTT communities into incident response efforts, as appropriate.
Authorities
The Cyber UCG works to establish shared objectives for threat response, asset response, and
intelligence support to guide cyber incident response and recovery efforts in the short to mid-term.
PPD-41 establishes the Cyber UCG and frames this concept of operations. PPD-41 does not alter,
supersede, or limit the authorities of federal agencies to carry out their functions and duties consistent
with applicable legal authorities and other Presidential guidance and directives. Instead, PPD-41
complements and builds upon PPD-8 on National Preparedness by integrating cyber and traditional
preparedness efforts to manage incidents that include both cyber and physical effects. It also
leverages the SSA construct and assignments of PPD-21 on Critical Infrastructure Security and
Resilience. The Cyber UCG bolsters a unity of effort and does not alter agency authorities or
leadership, oversight, or command responsibilities, unless mutually agreed upon between the relevant
agency heads and consistent with applicable legal authorities, including the Economy Act of 1932.

31

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Cyber UCG Formation
A Cyber UCG will be formed and activated only in the event of a significant cyber incident and will
be incident specific. Cyber UCG will be formed by any of the following processes:


At the direction of the National Security Council Principals Committee (Secretary level),
Deputies Committee (Deputy Security level), or the CRG;



When two or more federal agencies that generally participate in the CRG, including relevant
SSAs, request its formation based on their assessment of the cyber incident against the severity
schema; and or



When a significant cyber incident affects critical infrastructure owners and operators identified
by the Secretary of Homeland Security for which a cyber incident could reasonably result in
catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national
security

A Cyber UCG will dissolve when enhanced coordination procedures for threat and asset response are
no longer required or the authorities, capabilities, or resources of more than one federal agency are
no longer required to manage the remaining facets of the federal response to an incident.
Cyber UCG Responsibilities
Per PPD-41, a Cyber UCG conducts the following activities to promote unity of effort in response to
a significant cyber incident:


Coordinates the cyber incident response in a manner consistent with the principles described in
the Section III of PPD-41 Annex;



Ensures all appropriate federal agencies, including SSAs, are incorporated into the incident
response;



Coordinates the development and execution of response and recovery tasks, priorities, and
planning efforts, including international and cross-sector outreach, necessary to respond
appropriately to the incident and to speed recovery;



Facilitates the rapid and appropriate sharing of information and intelligence among Cyber UCG
participants on the incident response and recovery activities;



Coordinates consistent, accurate, and appropriate communications regarding the incident to
affected parties and stakeholders (and those who could be affected), including the public as
appropriate; and



For incidents that include cyber and physical effects, forms a combined UCG with the lead
federal agency or with any UCG established to manage the physical effects of the incident under
the NRF developed pursuant to PPD-8: National Preparedness, 38 or other applicable presidential
policy directives.

The Cyber UCG will promptly coordinate with DOJ, general counsel from DHS, regulators, and
other relevant federal agencies’ attorneys about pertinent legal issues as they are identified to quickly
consider and coordinate them with appropriate nongovernmental entities, as necessary.

32

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Cyber UCG Participation
Per PPD-41, when a Cyber UCG is established, the Federal Government establishes three lead
agencies to effectively respond to significant cyber incidents:


DHS is the lead agency for asset response during a significant cyber incident, acting through the
NCCIC. The NCCIC includes representation from the private sector, SLTT, and numerous
federal agencies. It is a focal point for sharing cybersecurity information, information about risks
and incidents, analysis, and warnings among federal and non-federal entities.



DOJ is the lead agency for threat response during a significant cyber incident, acting through
the FBI and the NCIJTF. Consisting of over 20 partner agencies from across law enforcement,
the IC, and the DoD, the NCIJTF serves as a multi-agency focal point for coordinating,
integrating, and sharing pertinent information related to cyber threat investigations.



ODNI is the lead coordinator for intelligence support during a significant cyber incident, acting
through the CTIIC. CTIIC provides situational awareness, sharing of relevant intelligence
information, integrated analysis of threat trends, events, and support to interagency efforts to
develop options to degrade or mitigate adversary threat capabilities. CTIIC also coordinates any
intelligence collection activities that may take place as part of the incident, including
identification of intelligence gaps, through the National Intelligence Manager, Cyber. Drawing
upon the resources and capabilities across the Federal Government, the lead federal agencies are
responsible for:



Coordinating any multi-agency threat or asset response activities to provide unity of effort, to
include coordinating with any agency providing support to the incident, to include SSAs in
recognition of their unique expertise;



Ensuring that their respective lines of effort are coordinated with other Cyber UCG participants
and affected entities, as appropriate;



Identifying and recommending to the CRG, if elevation is required, any additional Federal
Government resources or actions necessary to appropriately respond to and recover from the
incident; and



Coordinating with affected entities on various aspects of threat, asset, and affected entity
response activities through a Cyber UCG, as appropriate.

In addition to the lead federal agencies, a Cyber UCG will also include SSAs, if the cyber incident
affects or is likely to affect sectors they represent as well as other federal cybersecurity centers as
deemed necessary per the specific significant cyber incident. All federal agencies responding to the
significant cyber incident will participate in, and coordinate their response activities with, a Cyber
UCG.
SLTT government will be asked to participate in a Cyber UCG when the government entity owns or
operates critical infrastructure that is or may be affected by that particular significant cyber incident.
Otherwise, the Cyber UCG will use existing collaboration and information sharing mechanisms to
provide regular updates to SLTT partners.
Like government participation, private sector involvement in a Cyber UCG will be limited to
organizations with significant responsibility, jurisdiction, capability, or authority for response for that
specific incident, which may not always include all organizations contributing resources to the
response. Private Sector Cyber UCG participation will be voluntary and participants should be from
organizations which can determine the incident priorities for each operational period and approve an
Incident Action Plan, to include commitment of their organizations’ resources to support execution
of the Incident Action Plan. Per the Guiding Principles in PPD-41, out of respect for an affected
33

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

entities’ privacy and sensitive private sector information, the Federal Government will coordinate
with the affected entity on the approach of wider incident dissemination for that incident. Cyber
UCG participants will be expanded or contracted as the situation changes during that particular
incident response.
Depending on the nature and extent of the incident, a Cyber UCG might also incorporate specific
ICT 39 companies, also known as ICT enablers, to directly assist on that specific incident response.
ICT enablers are companies whose functions and capabilities are the foundations of the global cyber
ecosystem. As such, it is these ICT enablers who are often best positioned to share information,
ensure engagement of key players across the Internet and ICT realms, and assist with large-scale
response efforts during a significant cyber incident.
Additionally, the Cyber UCG will continue to use several pre-existing and well-established
coordinating structures, such as SCCs, ISACs and routine operational calls, for information sharing
to ensure appropriate and timely sharing of actionable intelligence. As the operational arm for many
sectors, ISACs especially can assist in their specific sector and across sectors impact assessment as
the specific incident allows. Additional organizations may be engaged in response as participants in
a Cyber UCG staff or as liaising organizations working in cooperation with the incident management
team under separate leadership structures. Such organizations would generally have awareness of and
opportunities to provide input to the Incident Action Plan, but would not be responsible for its
contents or execution.
Regardless of specific participant composition, a Cyber UCG shall operate in a manner that is
consistent with the need to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, operations,
and investigations, the privacy of individuals, and sensitive and protected private sector information.

Information Sharing During Cyber Incident Response
Cyber UCGs share cyber threat information developed during incident response with other
stakeholders as quickly, openly, and regularly as possible, to ensure protective measures can be
applied with all applicable stakeholders. This sharing may at times be constrained by law, regulation,
interests of the affected entity, classification or security requirements, or other operational
considerations. However, participants will strive for unity of message when sharing with
stakeholders and the public. Existing cyber threat information sharing channels will be used to
disseminate such information where feasible.
In some cases, depending on how a Cyber UCG’s participants have decided to staff a particular
incident, this sharing could also take place via a Public Information Officer designated by the Cyber
UCG or via a Joint Information Center staffed by representatives of responding organizations. In
some cases, ad hoc information sharing mechanisms are required to provide effective situational
awareness to interested or affected stakeholders. In all cases, Cyber UCGs protect the privacy of
individuals and sensitive private sector information, as appropriate.

Conclusion
America’s efforts to strengthen the security and resilience of networked technologies are never
finished. To achieve this security and resilience, the public-private partnership is integral to
collectively identifying priorities, articulating clear goals, mitigating risk, and adapting and evolving
based on feedback and the changing environment. The Federal Government, SLTT governments, and

the Private and International partners remain resolute in its commitment to safeguard networks,
systems and applications against the greatest cyber risks it faces, now and for decades to come.
The DHS Office of Cybersecurity and Communications will coordinate and oversee reviews and
maintenance of the NCIRP in coordination with the DOJ, ODNI, and SSAs. The revision process
includes developing or updating any documents necessary to carry out capabilities. Significant
updates to the Plan will be vetted through a public-private senior-level review process. This Plan will
be reviewed in order to accomplish the following:


Assess and update information on the core capabilities in support of cyber and cyber-physical
incident response goals and objectives.

Annex B: Cyber Incident Severity Schema
Per Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-41 40, the U.S. federal cybersecurity centers, in coordination
with departments and agencies with a cybersecurity or cyber operations mission, adopted a common
schema for describing the severity of cyber incidents affecting the homeland, U.S. capabilities, or
U.S. interests. The schema establishes a common framework to evaluate and assess cyber incidents to
ensure that all departments and agencies have a common view of the:


Severity of a given incident;



Urgency required for responding to a given incident;



Seniority level necessary for coordinating response efforts; and



Level of investment required for response efforts.

Figure 1 below depicts several key elements of the schema.

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Annex D: Reporting Cyber Incidents to the Federal
Government 1
Cyber incidents can have serious consequences. The theft of private, financial, or other sensitive data
and cyber incidents that damage computer systems are capable of causing lasting harm to anyone
engaged in personal or commercial online transactions. Such risks are increasingly faced by
businesses, consumers, and all other users of the Internet.
A private sector entity that is a victim of a cyber incident can receive assistance from Federal
Government agencies, which are prepared to investigate the incident, help mitigate its consequences,
and to help prevent future incidents. For example, federal law enforcement agencies have highly
trained investigators who specialize in responding to cyber incidents for the express purpose of
disrupting threat actors who caused the incident and preventing harm to other potential victims.
In addition to law enforcement, other federal responders provide technical assistance to protect
assets, mitigate vulnerabilities, and offer on-scene response personnel to aid in incident recovery.
When supporting affected entities, the various agencies of the Federal Government work in tandem
to leverage their collective response expertise, apply their knowledge of cyber threats, preserve key
evidence, and use their combined authorities and capabilities both to minimize asset vulnerability and
bring malicious actors to justice. This Appendix explains when, what, and how to report to the
Federal Government in the event of a cyber incident.
When to Report to the Federal Government. A cyber incident is an event that could jeopardize the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of digital information or information systems. Cyber
incidents resulting in significant damage are of particular concern to the Federal Government.
Accordingly, victims are encouraged to report all cyber incidents that may:


Result in a significant loss of data, system availability, or control of systems;



Impact a large number of victims;



Indicate unauthorized access to, or malicious software present on, critical information technology
systems;



Affect critical infrastructure or core government functions; or



Impact national security, economic security, or public health and safety.

The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) requires federal executive
Branch civilian agencies to notify and consult with US-CERT regarding information security
incidents involving their information and information systems, whether managed by a federal
agency, contractor, or other source.
What to Report. A cyber incident may be reported at various stages, even when complete
information is not available. Helpful information could include who you are, who experienced the
incident, what sort of incident occurred, how and when the incident was initially detected, what
response actions have already been taken, and who has been notified.

1

This document was created in conjunction with Presidential Policy Directive 41 to provide the public with a
unified federal message explaining how and when to report cyber incidents for purposes of obtaining assistance
from the Federal Government. It does not address mandatory reporting pursuant to law, regulation, or contract.
Such required reporting should continue to occur through designated federal points of contact using existing
procedures.

40

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

How to Report Cyber Incidents to the Federal Government. Private sector entities experiencing
cyber incidents are encouraged to report a cyber incident to the local field offices of federal law
enforcement agencies, their sector specific agency, or any of the federal agencies listed in Table 1
below. The federal agency receiving the initial report will coordinate with other relevant federal
stakeholders to respond to the incident. If the affected entity is obligated by law or contract to report
a cyber incident, the entity should comply with that obligation, in addition to voluntarily reporting
the incident to an appropriate federal point of contact. Federal agencies also collaborates with state,
local, territorial and tribal government organizations as appropriate given the nature of the cyber
incident.
Types of Federal Incident Response. Upon receiving a report of a cyber incident, the Federal
Government will promptly focus its efforts on two activities: threat response and asset response:


Threat response includes attributing, pursuing, and disrupting malicious cyber actors and
malicious cyber activity. It includes conducting criminal investigations and other actions to
counter the malicious cyber activity.



Asset response includes protecting assets and mitigating vulnerabilities in the face of malicious
cyber activity. It includes reducing the impact to systems and/or data; strengthening, recovering
and restoring services; identifying other entities at risk; and assessing potential risk to the broader
community and mitigating potential privacy risks to affected individuals.

Irrespective of the type of incident or its corresponding response, federal agencies work together to
help affected entities understand the incident, link related incidents, and share information to rapidly
resolve the situation in a manner that protects privacy and civil liberties.

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

Annex G: Developing an Internal Cyber Incident Response
Plan
This Annex describes processes that may be used for cyber incident response planning. The first
subsection describes the national operational planning process. The second subsection outlines a
planning process that individual entities may take.

National Operational Planning
An operational plan is a continuous, evolving instrument of anticipated actions that maximizes
opportunities and guides response operations. Operational plans are “living documents,” subject to
revision as incidents evolve and new information becomes available. Operational plans seek to:


Improve coordination, collaboration, and communication to identify and prioritize plans of
actions and steps at various thresholds of escalation surrounding a cyber incident;



Improve the ability to gather, analyze, and de-conflict multiple sources of information to produce
timely and actionable situational awareness;



Issue alerts and warnings across a broad range of stakeholders to raise awareness and initiate
incident response activities, consequence management, and business continuity plans;



Reduce redundancy and duplication that could adversely impact effective coordination by
articulating and affirming various roles and responsibilities;



Enhance predictability and sustainability to improve collaboration necessary to manage
consequences and assess and mitigate impact; and



Include flexibility and agility to adapt to emerging events and activities.

Operational planning is conducted across the broader community and is an inherent responsibility of
every level of government and the private sector. Operational plans should be routinely exercised to
ensure identify gaps and establish continuous improvement plans to improve preparedness and
effectiveness of the information sharing process surrounding a cyber incident.
This NCIRP is not an operational plan for responding to cyber incidents. However, it should serve as
the primary strategic approach for stakeholders to utilize when developing agency- and organizationspecific operational plans. This common doctrine will foster unity of effort for emergency operations
planning and it will help those affected by cyber incidents to understand how federal departments,
agencies, and other national-level broader community partners provide resources to support the
SLTT communities and private sector response operations.

Response Operational Planning
Both the Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101 45 and the Response Federal Interagency
Operational Plan (FIOP) 46 are foundational documents that agencies and organizations can leverage
and tailor to cyber incidents to develop their own operational response plans.

National Cyber Incident Response Plan

The CPG 101 provides information on various types of plans and guidance on the fundamentals of
planning. Federal plans for incidents are developed using a six-step process, in alignment with the
steps described in CPG 101:


Form a collaborative planning team



Understand the situation



Determine the goals and objectives



Develop the plan



Prepare, review, and approve the plan



Implement and maintain the plan.

The Response FIOP outlines how the Federal Government delivers the response core capabilities.
The Response FIOP provides information regarding roles and responsibilities, identifies the critical
tasks an entity takes in executing core capabilities, and identifies resourcing and sourcing
requirements. It addresses interdependencies and integration with the other mission areas throughout
the plan’s concept of operations. It also describes the management of concurrent actions and
coordination points with the areas of prevention, protection, mitigation, and recovery. It does not
contain detailed descriptions of specific department or agency functions, as such information is
located in department- or agency-level operational plans.
The NRF and NIMS guide the Response FIOP. The NRF is based on the concept of tiered response,
with an understanding that most incidents start at the local and tribal level, and as needs exceed
resources and capabilities, additional SLTT and federal assets are applied. The Response FIOP,
therefore, aligns with other SLTT, insular area, and federal plans to ensure that all response partners
share a common operational focus. Similarly, integration occurs at the federal level among the
departments, agencies, and nongovernmental partners that compose the respective mission area
through the frameworks, FIOPs, and departmental and agency operations plans.

Application
While the NRF does not direct the actions of other response elements, the guidance contained in the
NRF and the Response FIOP informs SLTT and insular area governments, as well as nongovernment
organizations and the private sector, regarding how the Federal Government responds to incidents.
These partners can use this information to inform their planning and ensure that assumptions
regarding federal assistance and response, and the manner in which federal support will be provided,
are accurate.

Developing an Internal Cyber Incident Response Plan
Public and private sector entities should consider creating an entity-specific operational cyber
incident response plan to further organize and coordinate their efforts in response to cyber incidents.
Each organization should consider a plan that meets its unique requirements and relates to the
organization’s mission, size, structure, and functions.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-61 (revision 2) 47
outlines several elements to consider when developing a cyber incident response plan. Each plan
should be tailored and prioritized to meet the needs of the organization and adhere to current
information sharing and reporting requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist. As
